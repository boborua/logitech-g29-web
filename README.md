# Logitech G29 Web Controller

This project is a web-based adaptation of the [logitech-g29](https://github.com/nightmode/logitech-g29) Node.js library, which was originally created by [nightmode](https://github.com/nightmode). The original library provides excellent support for the Logitech G29 Racing Wheel in Node.js environments.

- Access the G29 wheel's inputs through web browsers
- Create web-based racing games and simulators
- Develop web applications that can interact with the G29 wheel
- Provide a more accessible way to use the G29 wheel without requiring Node.js installation
